# PythonPractice
Over the summer of 2021, I self-studied Python and its various important libraries through online courses and textbooks. Many of these are my implementations of exercises. I worked on most of these over the summer of 2021, uploading them on Dec 2021. 
Each file has a description of what I learned as its commit message. In summary, I learned about the fundamentals of Python, the matplotlib and numpy libraries, requesting and REST APIs, and various image processing libraries such as PIL, PyTesseract, and Kraken.
